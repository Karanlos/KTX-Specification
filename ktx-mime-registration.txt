Type name: Image

Subtype name: ktx

Required parameters: none

Optional parameters: none

Encoding considerations: binary

Security considerations:

The ktx type is a binary data stream which contains no executable code that
could disrupt a client processor. There is no provision in the type
specification that would allow authors to insert executable code that would
present any security risk to a client machine. 

Because every item's length is available at it's beginning, there is robust
defense agains corrupted or fraudelent data. Also the signature bytes
provide early detection of common file transmission errors.

Interoperability considerations:

ktx data includes a field identifying the endianness of the machine which
created the data. Applications reading the data are expected to check this
field and convert the endianness of the data, if necessary. The texture data
payload may be compressed using an OpenGL-vendor-specific scheme. In this
case, only devices or applications having a way of decompressing that data
will be able to display it.

Published specification:

Applications that use this media type :

Currently only etcpack (http://devtools.ericsson.com/etc). It is anticipated
it will be widely used by applications built on top of the OpenGL family of
standards, OpenGL, OpenGL ES and WebGL, as the means of delivering texture
data.
